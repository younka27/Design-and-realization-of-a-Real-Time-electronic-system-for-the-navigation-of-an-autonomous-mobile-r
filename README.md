# Design-of-an-autonomous-mobile-robot-controlled-by-EEG
In this project, a BCI robotic platform controlled by an EEG signal was designed and developed. A Neurosky EEG headset is used to detect and collect the EEG signal. To ensure the performance of the HMI platform, we decided to use the EEG signal is considered as a Human-Computer Interaction to control the mechanical movement of the robotic platform. Three analyzes based on EEG signals have been developed so that three separate EEG signals are required for each movement :

-The concentration signal was used to make a forward movement with variation in speed;

-the meditation signal to stop the robot;

-the eye blink signal contributes to a movement to the left to change navigation;

The EEG signals (alpha, beta,)  are sampled and trained using Thinkgear technology.
Tests were performed on the platform for five subjects to determine the performance of the Neurosky helmet. The experimental results obtained are satisfactory. The overall system accuracy achieved is 80%, with a minimum of electrodes required. Therefore, it can be said that the studied system can completely interact with the human brain with all the physiological changes of people.



Prospects for future work can be developed as part of our additional research master's training. Some avenues to explore include:

- The decisional architecture for face recognition can be taken as it is, with adjustments to the level of the training module using artificial intelligence approaches for automatic learning (Deep learning);

- A new electronic interface will be developed with the integration of artificial intelligence for voice recognition;

- The adaptation of a 'Cloud' platform, for the two recognition processes;

- The use of a multi-channel EEG headset should also increase autonomous navigation capabilities under different physiological conditions.
